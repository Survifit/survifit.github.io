  <p>Currently enrolled in the Data Visualization and Analytics boot camp at the University of Minnesota, 
    I am focused on unifying current and new skills into the role of a Data Scientist. I want to help organizations, 
    especially non-profits, more efficiently tell their story to current and prospective stakeholders while increasing 
    overall effectiveness.</p>
  <p>Working with organizations of varying sizes across the full spectrum of private, public, non-profit, and 
    volunteer-based in a variety of regulatory environments, combined with my MIS degree, gives me a diverse background
     that allows for quick adaptation to new systems and environments, while understanding networking, security, 
     business continuity, and disaster recovery concerns. </p>
  <p>Continuously seeking to expand and improve upon my capabilities as a communicator and my general knowledge 
    of the world helps me converse with subject experts and connect otherwise disparate topics. My current reading 
    list centers around modeling complex systems, economics, energy, and artificial intelligence.</p>
